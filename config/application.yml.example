# Configurations for each environment
# You can find below the sections for each environment available.
# Uncomment the lines from one of them to define specific configurations for that environment.
# You can copy any of the parameters from the default section and override them here.
# Remember to copy the entire sections: if you want to override "site.smtp_login" and
# "admin.username", you must do something like:
#
# development:
#   site:
#     smtp_login: "override the SMTP login"
#   admin:
#     username: "my-special-admin"
#
# Also remember to maintain the file indented with 2 spaces. The YML file must be well
# formatted to be valid.
